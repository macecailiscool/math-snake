# Math Snake Game

Math Snake is a simple browser-based game where players control a snake and navigate it on a game board to collect food while avoiding collisions with boundaries, enemies, and itself. The game incorporates math problems to challenge players and has a health system that affects gameplay. 

## Gameplay

- The objective of the game is to control the snake and collect food while avoiding collisions.
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
- The snake grows longer as it collects food.
- Colliding with enemies or getting hit by bullets decreases the snake's health.
- Solve math problems correctly to regain health.
- The game ends if the snake collides with boundaries, enemies, or itself or if the snake's health reaches 0.

## Game Elements

- **Snake**: The green parts on the game board represent the snake. The snake grows longer as it collects food.
- **Food**: The red square represents the food. Move the snake over it to collect it and gain points.
- **Enemies**: The blue squares are enemies. Colliding with enemies reduces the snake's health.
- **Bullets**: The black dots are bullets shot by enemies. Getting hit by bullets decreases the snake's health.
- **Health Bar**: The health bar at the top of the screen represents the snake's health. It decreases when colliding with enemies or getting hit by bullets. When the health reaches 0, the game ends.
